# CSX_RPROJECT_SPRING2019
This is for the CS+X course 2019 Spring.
## HW0
Since I can't download the file from TA's github in class, I submitted my old project from 台大AI中心 instead.
## HW1
### In class progress
- Help 組員 顏維君 & 李孟哲 solve some pandas install problems.
- Finish most of th work but without description and plot titles.
### At-home progress
- It seems to me that I've finished hw1 later on the same day.
- All the figures and code are in the file [hw1/EDA_hw1.ipynb](./hw1/EDA_hw1.ipynb)
